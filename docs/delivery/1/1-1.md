## Requirements

1. Initialize Node.js project with pnpm
2. Create `package.json` with:
   - Extension metadata (name, displayName, description, version)
   - Activation events (onCommand)
   - Command contributions for all PBI 1 commands
   - Engine compatibility (VS Code version)
3. Create `tsconfig.json` with strict TypeScript settings
4. Create basic `src/extension.ts` with activate/deactivate functions
5. Create `.vscodeignore` for publishing
6. Set up build scripts in package.json

## Implementation Plan

1. Run `pnpm init` to create package.json
2. Install dependencies: `@types/vscode`, `typescript`, `@vscode/vsce`
3. Configure package.json with VS Code extension fields
4. Create tsconfig.json with module resolution for VS Code
5. Create src/extension.ts with placeholder activate function
6. Create .vscodeignore

## Verification

- [x] `pnpm install` completes without errors
- [x] `pnpm run compile` builds TypeScript successfully
- [ ] Extension can be loaded in VS Code Extension Development Host
- [ ] Commands appear in command palette (even if not functional yet)

## Test Plan

- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Extension activates in development host without errors
- Registered commands appear in command palette

## Files Modified

- `package.json` (created)
- `tsconfig.json` (created)
- `src/extension.ts` (created)
- `.vscodeignore` (created)
- `.gitignore` (created)
