Create the command handler for viewing all saved prompts in a quick pick display.

## Requirements

1. Register `instaprompt.listPrompts` command in extension.ts
2. Show quick pick with all prompts (name + content preview)
3. Display prompt count in title
4. Handle case of no prompts gracefully
5. Selecting a prompt shows its full content (optional enhancement)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create command handler function
2. Get prompts from promptManager
3. Format prompts for quick pick display:
   - Label: prompt name
   - Description: truncated content (first 50 chars)
4. Show quick pick with formatted items
5. Handle empty list with informative message

## Verification

- [ ] Command appears in command palette

- [ ] Shows informative message when no prompts exist
- [ ] Can scroll through many prompts

## Test Plan
