[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create the main command handler for the prompt selection quick pick that users trigger via hotkey.

## Status History

| 2025-12-23 12:00:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created | User |

## Requirements

1. Register `instaprompt.selectPrompt` command in extension.ts
2. Show quick pick with all saved prompts
3. Enable fuzzy filtering for fast search
4. Display prompt name as label, truncated content as description
5. Return selected prompt for clipboard handling (Task 2-2)
6. Handle empty prompt list gracefully

## Implementation Plan

1. Create command handler function
2. Get prompts from promptManager
3. Create QuickPickItems with:
   - label: prompt name
   - description: first line of content (truncated)
   - detail: optional category
4. Show quick pick with matchOnDescription enabled
5. Return selected prompt content
6. Handle cancellation and empty state

## Verification
