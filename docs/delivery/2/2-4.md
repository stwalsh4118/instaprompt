## Status History

|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-12-23 12:00:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created | User |
| 2025-12-23 13:45:00 | Status Change | Proposed | InProgress | Starting implementation | AI Agent |
| 2025-12-23 13:50:00 | Status Change | InProgress | Review | Implementation complete, ready for review | AI Agent |

## Requirements

1. Use `vscode.window.showInformationMessage()` for success
2. Message should be brief: "Prompt copied to clipboard"
3. Include prompt name in message for clarity
4. Use `vscode.window.showErrorMessage()` for failures
5. Notification should auto-dismiss (default VS Code behavior)

## Implementation Plan

1. After successful clipboard write, show info message
2. Format: "Copied '{promptName}' to clipboard"
3. On failure, show error message with details
4. Keep messages concise and non-intrusive

## Verification

- [x] Success message appears after copying
- [x] Message includes prompt name (format: "Copied '{promptName}' to clipboard")
- [x] Error message appears on failure (already implemented in Task 2-2)
- [x] Messages don't block user workflow (uses showInformationMessage/showErrorMessage which auto-dismiss)
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Test Plan

- Success notification shows after copy
- Prompt name appears in notification
- Notification doesn't require user action to dismiss

## Files Modified

- `src/extension.ts` (modified) - Added success notification after successful clipboard write in handleSelectPrompt
