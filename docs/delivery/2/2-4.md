# 2-4 Add Success Notification

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Show a brief notification message when a prompt is successfully copied to the clipboard.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-12-23 12:00:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created | User |

## Requirements

1. Use `vscode.window.showInformationMessage()` for success
2. Message should be brief: "Prompt copied to clipboard"
3. Include prompt name in message for clarity
4. Use `vscode.window.showErrorMessage()` for failures
5. Notification should auto-dismiss (default VS Code behavior)

## Implementation Plan

1. After successful clipboard write, show info message
2. Format: "Copied '{promptName}' to clipboard"
3. On failure, show error message with details
4. Keep messages concise and non-intrusive

## Verification

- [ ] Success message appears after copying
- [ ] Message includes prompt name
- [ ] Error message appears on failure
- [ ] Messages don't block user workflow

## Test Plan

- Success notification shows after copy
- Prompt name appears in notification
- Notification doesn't require user action to dismiss

## Files Modified

- `src/extension.ts` (modified)
