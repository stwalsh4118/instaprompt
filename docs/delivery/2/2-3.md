## Requirements

1. Add keybindings contribution to package.json
2. Default keybinding: `Win+Alt+L` (Windows/Linux), `Cmd+Alt+L` (Mac)
3. Bind to `instaprompt.selectPrompt` command
4. Keybinding should be customizable via VS Code settings

## Implementation Plan

1. Add `contributes.keybindings` section to package.json
2. Define keybinding:
   ```json
   {
     "command": "instaprompt.selectPrompt",
     "key": "win+alt+l",
     "mac": "cmd+alt+l"
   }
   ```

## Verification

- [x] Pressing Win+Alt+L opens prompt picker (keybinding configured)
- [x] Keybinding appears in VS Code keyboard shortcuts (added to contributes.keybindings)
- [x] User can customize keybinding in settings (VS Code default behavior)
- [x] JSON is valid and package.json structure is correct

## Test Plan

- Hotkey triggers the select prompt command
- Keybinding visible in keyboard shortcuts settings
- Customization through VS Code keybindings works

## Files Modified

- `package.json` (modified) - Added keybindings contribution with Win+Alt+L keybinding
