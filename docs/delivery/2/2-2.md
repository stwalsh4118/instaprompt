## Requirements

1. Use `vscode.env.clipboard.writeText()` to copy content
2. Integrate with select prompt command flow
3. Handle clipboard write errors gracefully
4. Return success/failure status for notification (Task 2-4)

## Implementation Plan

1. After prompt selection in Task 2-1, get prompt content
2. Call `vscode.env.clipboard.writeText(content)`
3. Handle any errors with try/catch
4. Return boolean indicating success

## Verification

- [x] Selected prompt content is copied to clipboard
- [x] Can paste content in any application (uses VS Code clipboard API)
- [x] Errors are caught and don't crash extension
- [x] Returns success/failure status with prompt name for notification (Task 2-4)
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes without errors

## Test Plan

- Selecting a prompt copies content to clipboard
- Content can be pasted elsewhere
- Error handling prevents crashes

## Files Modified

- `src/extension.ts` (modified) - Updated handleSelectPrompt to write to clipboard and return success status
