## Requirements

1. Use `vscode.env.clipboard.writeText()` to copy content
2. Integrate with select prompt command flow
3. Handle clipboard write errors gracefully
4. Return success/failure status for notification (Task 2-4)

## Implementation Plan

1. After prompt selection in Task 2-1, get prompt content
2. Call `vscode.env.clipboard.writeText(content)`
3. Handle any errors with try/catch
4. Return boolean indicating success

## Verification

- [ ] Selected prompt content is copied to clipboard
- [ ] Can paste content in any application
- [ ] Errors are caught and don't crash extension

## Test Plan

- Selecting a prompt copies content to clipboard
- Content can be pasted elsewhere
- Error handling prevents crashes

## Files Modified

- `src/extension.ts` (modified)
